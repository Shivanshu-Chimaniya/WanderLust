# Airbnb Clone Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my Airbnb clone! Created during the Delta batch, it delves into full-stack development. 
This journey has been challenging yet rewarding, offering hands-on experience. From server setup to UI design, every step aimed at grasping web app development intricacies. 
This repository contains all the code and resources used to bring this project to life.

## Features
- **Secure User Authentication**: Implementing industry-standard practices, the application offers a user signup and login process with password hashing and salting to ensure data security and user privacy.
- **Personalized Listings**: Users have the ability to add and manage their own listings, giving them the power to showcase their properties on the platform.
- **Owner Editing Options**: Property owners are provided with editing options, allowing them to update and modify their listings as needed.
- **User Reviews**: A review system enables guests to leave feedback on their experiences, contributing to the community-driven trust and quality assurance of listings.
- **Advanced Search Functionality**: The platform includes a dynamic search feature with multiple filters, enabling users to find the perfect listing that meets their specific requirements and preferences.

## Technologies Used
This project is built with a robust stack of technologies that ensure a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly experience:

- **Node.js**: As the backbone of our server, Node.js provides a powerful, event-driven environment that enables non-blocking I/O operations.

- **Express Framework**: Built on top of Node.js, Express simplifies the server creation process, making it easy to establish routes and middleware for our application.

- **MongoDB**: Our choice of database, MongoDB offers a flexible, schema-less structure that's perfect for handling the dynamic data models required by our platform.

- **Node Packages**:
  - `express-session`: Manages user sessions, maintaining state across multiple page requests.
  - `joi`: Validates user input to ensure data integrity throughout the application.
  - `passport`: Handles authentication, offering a suite of strategies to verify users securely.
  - `ejs`: Serves as the templating engine, allowing us to generate HTML with plain JavaScript.

- **RESTful APIs**: The application features a suite of RESTful APIs, providing a standardized approach to performing CRUD operations on the database, ensuring seamless communication between the client and server.

- **MVC Architecture**: Employing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, the project is structured to separate concerns, enhance maintainability, and facilitate scalability.

- **Cloud Technologies**:
  - **MongoDB Atlas**: Provides cloud storage for our MongoDB database, ensuring high availability and scalability.
  - **Render**: Acts as our hosting service, offering seamless deployment and management of web applications.
  - **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based service that efficiently manages and stores images uploaded by users, optimizing performance and user experience.

Each technology has been carefully selected to contribute to the overall functionality and performance of the Airbnb clone, making it a comprehensive full-stack project.

## Setup and Installation
- **Clone**: run `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`.
- **Install Dependecies**: run `npm install`.
- **Start server**: run `Node index.js`.
- **Open**: go to `localhost:8080/listings` on any web browser.
